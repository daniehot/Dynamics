> * Project Title: (Analyzing different food queues dynamics at different Mensas at ETH Zürich using Cellular automata and other aproaches)

## General Introduction

(Wherever people are the demnand of food is crucial. especially at a big university like the ETH. There are several different offers at different places to feed the immense amount of hungry students and academical statt. Since the beginning of the Spring semester 2014 the chemistry biuliding HCI at the ETH hoenggerberg the Restaurant opened it's doors, which was rebuilt  in order to optimize the troughput and space for the masses of people. Here the before and afteer situation of the food service and cashier line are investigated and compared to other architectures of different Mensas a the ETH zürich.)

## The Model
(During the two hours the Restaurant it open a dynamic flow of people enters the food service line. A first decision is made by the choice of the menu and resolves in a specific distribution of people at the diffenet stations. The walk to the cashpoint folloes which is the  same for evereyone. The total troughput depends on the number of food stations and chashpoints and the architecture of the Mensa.)


## Fundamental Questions
(How is the choice of the food been made? How many food stations and chashpoints per space can be used to generate the maximum troughput? How does the architecture influence the floww of te people)


## Expected Results

(For the Mensa in the chemistry biulding a clear improvement of the trhoughput is expected which can be explained by the reasons mentioned above. Additional a comparison to the POlymensa at the main builing will go in favor to the Chemistry Mensa due to empirical valies)

## Research Methods

(Cellular Automata, Agent-Based Model, Continuous Modeling...) (If you are not sure here: 1. Consult your colleagues, 2. ask the teachers, 3. remember that you can change it afterwards)


## Other

(Mensas could be asked if they provide us numercal data of menues and there distibution )
